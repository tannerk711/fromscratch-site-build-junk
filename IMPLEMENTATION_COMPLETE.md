## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Current Setup (Required)
- **Anthropic Claude:** ~$0.01 per estimate
- **Cloudinary:** Free (25GB/month)
- **Vercel:** Free tier

### For 100 Leads/Month
- Total: ~$10/month (just Claude API)

### For 500 Leads/Month
- Claude: ~$50/month
- Resend: $20/month (if sending emails)
- Supabase: Free (within limits)
- **Total: ~$70/month**

## 🎨 Customization

### Adjust Pricing
Edit `junk-hauler-site/src/lib/pricing.js`:
```javascript
const PRICING_TIERS = {
  base_rate_per_yard: 25,  // Change this
  minimum_charge: 150,      // Change this
  // etc...
};
```

### Modify Form Steps
- Add/remove property types in `PropertyTypeStep.jsx`
- Add/remove junk categories in `JunkTypeStep.jsx`
- Update cities in `LocationStep.jsx`

### Improve AI Accuracy
After collecting real data:
1. Compare AI estimates vs actual cubic yards
2. Update reference examples in `src/pages/api/estimate.js`
3. Fine-tune the prompt based on patterns

## 📊 Analytics (Optional Future Enhancement)

Consider adding:
- Google Analytics for form completion rates
- Conversion tracking for quote-to-booking ratio
- A/B testing different CTA copy
- Form abandonment tracking

## 🔒 Security Notes

- API keys are server-side only (not exposed to browser)
- Cloudinary upload preset should be unsigned but restricted to images
- Supabase uses Row Level Security (configure policies)
- Rate limiting should be added for production (Vercel Edge Config)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Form not loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify React integration: `npm run dev` should start without errors

### Photos not uploading
- Check Cloudinary credentials
- Verify upload preset is "unsigned"
- Check browser console for upload errors

### AI estimation failing
- Verify Anthropic API key
- Check server console for errors
- Ensure photos are accessible URLs
- Note Claude rate limits (adjust if needed)

### Pricing seems off
- Review `src/lib/pricing.js` configuration
- Check AI estimate ranges
- Verify surcharges are correct
