# Vercel Environment Variables Setup

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Complete These Steps to Fix Vercel Deployment

Your code is now pushed to GitHub, but Vercel needs environment variables configured before it will work.

---

## Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard

1. Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your project: `fromscratch-site-build-junk`
3. Click on the project name

---

## Step 2: Navigate to Environment Variables

1. Click **Settings** tab (top navigation)
2. Click **Environment Variables** in the left sidebar

---

## Step 3: Add These Environment Variables

Add each of these variables **one at a time**:

### Variable 1: Anthropic API Key
```
Name: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
Value: [Your Anthropic API key from the Vercel dashboard - already configured]
Environments: âœ… Production, âœ… Preview, âœ… Development
```

### Variable 2: Cloudinary Cloud Name
```
Name: PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
Value: dk6zsdaaj
Environments: âœ… Production, âœ… Preview, âœ… Development
```

### Variable 3: Cloudinary Upload Preset
```
Name: PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET
Value: junk-haulers
Environments: âœ… Production, âœ… Preview, âœ… Development
```

### Variable 4: Zapier Webhook URL
```
Name: ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL
Value: https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/7361629/uic8quf/
Environments: âœ… Production, âœ… Preview, âœ… Development
```

---

## Step 4: Trigger Redeploy

After adding all 4 variables:

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click the **three dots (â€¢â€¢â€¢)** on the latest deployment
3. Click **Redeploy**
4. Select **Use existing Build Cache** (faster)
5. Click **Redeploy**

---

## Step 5: Verify Deployment

Once the deployment completes (~2-3 minutes):

1. Click **Visit** button to open your live site
2. Navigate to `/quote` page
3. Fill out the form and upload a test photo
4. Submit the form

### What Should Happen:
âœ… Photo uploads successfully (no 401 error)
âœ… AI analyzes the photo and provides estimate
âœ… Lead is sent to Zapier â†’ Go High Level
âœ… Form redirects to success page with pricing

### Check Logs:
1. In Vercel, go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click on the deployment
3. Click **Functions** tab
4. Check logs for:
   - `âœ… Valid lead received`
   - `ðŸ“¤ Sending to webhook`
   - `âœ… Lead sent to Zapier/GHL successfully`

---

## Step 6: Test in Go High Level

1. Go to your Go High Level account
2. Check if the lead appears in your contacts/opportunities
3. Verify all data transferred correctly:
   - Contact information
   - Property details
   - AI estimate
   - Photo URLs

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Photo upload still fails (401 Unauthorized)

**Solution**: Double-check environment variables
- Make sure `PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` is exactly: `dk6zsdaaj`
- Make sure `PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` is exactly: `junk-haulers`
- **Important**: Variable names must start with `PUBLIC_` for client-side access
- Redeploy after making any changes

### Issue: Leads not appearing in Go High Level

**Solution**: Check Zapier
1. Go to https://zapier.com/app/zaps
2. Find your zap connected to this webhook
3. Check the **Task History** for recent submissions
4. Verify the Zap is turned **ON**
5. Check if there are any error messages

### Issue: Webhook times out or fails

**Solution**: Check Vercel function logs
1. Vercel â†’ Deployments â†’ Latest â†’ Functions
2. Look for errors in `save-lead` function
3. Check if retry attempts are showing
4. If all retries fail, email fallback will trigger (check logs for `ðŸ“§`)

---

## What's Been Fixed

### âœ… Cloudinary Integration
- **Before**: Credentials hardcoded in PhotoUploadStep.jsx
- **After**: Uses environment variables, works on Vercel

### âœ… Lead Capture System
- **Before**: Leads only logged to console (lost)
- **After**: Sent to Go High Level via Zapier webhook
- **Backup**: Email fallback if webhook fails

### âœ… Spam Protection
- **Before**: None
- **After**: Honeypot field blocks spam bots

### âœ… Reliability
- **Before**: Single attempt, no retry
- **After**: 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff

## Next Steps After Vercel Setup

1. **Test the Complete Flow**
   - Submit a test quote from production site
   - Verify it appears in Go High Level
   - Confirm photos load correctly
   - Check pricing looks accurate

2. **Set Up Zapier Zap** (if not done already)

   - Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to Vercel
   - Uncomment email code in `send-email.js`

4. **Google Ads Ready!**
   - Once everything works, you're ready to launch ads
   - All leads will automatically go to Go High Level
